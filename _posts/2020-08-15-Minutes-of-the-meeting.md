### Agenda : 
* Discuss Movie Project.

### Discussed in the meeting : 
1. Five prompts have been given to pick from
2. The movie that you pick has to satisfy at least one of the prompts 
3. The prompts are not mutually exclusive. If you find a movie that fits more than one prompts, even better
4. No documentaries or web series
5. No movie reviews - your articles have to be inspired by an aspect of the movie
6. The movie can be of any genre
7. Keep in mind your audience while writing the article (18 and above)
8. Create a #moviechallenge on Instagram and announce the challenge on kMITRA's IG handle. Invite reader suggestions. Announce movies chosen by writers (as and when they choose them). Keep engaging followers till the edition goes live. 

### Review of Book Edition :
* Motive was to make your article readable and interesting for all those who have read your book and also all those who haven’t.

### Blog:
* Different name for blog(url) since site may crash if included under the same name
* Can expect the blog to go live along with September edition
